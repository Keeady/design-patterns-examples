    <h1>The Factory Pattern</h1>
    <p>
        Factory design pattern is a creational pattern which
        offload the instantiation of objects to other classes.
        One of the motivation for using Factory pattern is to
        reduce coupling between the client and its dependencies.
        Another use case is when creating an object is complex and
        the process can be reused in other parts of the system.
        In the example code, the client can switch between different
        concrete factory implementation with just a few changes.
    </p>
    <h4>Factory Method vs Factory Class</h4>
    <p>
        A factory class pattern provides different concrete subclasses
        for the client to choose from. It's easy to add new factory subclass
        in the future for different type of meal for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
        A factory method is simple and easy to implement. However,
        it can easily grow out of proportion and could violate the open
        close principle. To add a new type of meal, for instance, the factory
        method needs to be modified.
